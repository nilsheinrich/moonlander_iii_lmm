Data folder contains the data sets for close and distant fixations.

Model selection - random effects are chosen based on BIC. Hypothesis testing is done on the basis of parametric bootstraps with N=10000 iterations. An effect is considered significant if the 95% HDPI of the distribution of values obtained from the bootstrap does not intersect with the 0-line.
